# Gravitational Force Calculator
A program that calculates the gravitational force between two people given suitable inputs.

## Setup
1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you don't already have it.

2. Open terminal and run the git clone command:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cramaechi/gravitational-force-calculator.git
   ```
    or [download as ZIP](https://github.com/cramaechi/gravitational-force-calculator/archive/master.zip).

3. Go to the project folder:

   ```
   $ cd gravitational-force-calculator
   ```

4. Compile:

   ```
   $ make
   ```
   
## Usage
Run:

```
$ ./gforce_calculator
```

Sample Output:
```
Enter the masses (in kilograms) of two objects and the distance (in meters) between them: 100 150 6
